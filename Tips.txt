Access Modifiers 

- Private : It can be accessed within the class only
- Protected : It can be accessed within the derived classes
- Internal : It can be accessed within the class library.
(Incase of internal we can look at a example: 
 If we have a class that contains connection string(sensitive) then it should not be called directly from other libraries
 So we can make a method that can access the connection string and perform some operation and give access to that method if needed.
 We dont give access to the connection string class directly
)
-Class can only be public, internal
-Protected Internal Method can be accssed by class that is within the derived class and same class library or other library
-Private Protected Method can be accssed by class that is within the derived class and same class library
-To call method of parents methods from child method use base.ParentMethodName(); or simply ParentMethodName();

Use Cases of Each:
Private, Public (Most of the time)
Protected, Internal (Sometimes)
Protected Internal(May encounter sometimes)
Private Protected(Rarely)

Pro Tips: Identify who needs an object in order to understand which modifiers it need. (Start with private and then later change it later if needed)
